# How to operate the codes in the codes folder:

1. Please first run Part 1 in Python(version 3).
2. Then run Part 2 in R studio(version 3.5.1).
2. Part 1 will generate outpuData.csv, this feeds into Part 2.
3. Part 2 also takes in demographic file named: "sub_demographic_data.csv". 
4. Part 2 will generate final output file: 33585886_outputdata.csv & data analysis.
5. The first few lines in the code files will tell more specifically what is included in the codes.


### Notice:

Make sure that if you wish to rerun the code for part 1(python), delete the previous output file(outpuData.csv) first, otherwise it will append to the existing file but not overwrite the file.
